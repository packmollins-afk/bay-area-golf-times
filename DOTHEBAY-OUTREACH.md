## Option 1: Email to DoTheBay Partnerships

**To:** partnerships@dothebay.com (or via https://dothebay.com/p/advertise)

**Subject:** Partnership Idea: Golf The Bay × Do The Bay

---

Hi DoTheBay team,

I'm the founder of **Golf The Bay** (golfthebay.com) — a tee time aggregator covering 100+ public golf courses across the SF Bay Area.

When naming the site, I was directly inspired by DoTheBay. The "[Verb] The Bay" format perfectly captures what we're both doing: helping locals discover and do things in the Bay Area.

**Quick stats on Golf The Bay:**
- 100+ courses: SF, East Bay, South Bay, North Bay, Napa, Monterey
- Real-time tee time availability and price comparison
- Growing organic traffic from Google (we rank for "bay area golf tee times")

**Partnership ideas:**
1. **Recreation vertical** — Golf could be a natural fit in your Recreation/Sports categories
2. **Cross-promotion** — We'd feature DoTheBay as a "what to do after golf" resource; you'd list us for golf
3. **Content collaboration** — "Best Golf + [Wine/Brunch/Date] Combos in the Bay"
4. **Affiliate** — Happy to offer commission on bookings from DoTheBay referrals

Our audiences overlap: active Bay Area locals looking for things to do. Golf is a $84B industry and the Bay Area has some of the best public courses in California.

Would love to explore how we could work together. Open to a quick call or happy to share more details over email.

Best,
[Your Name]

## Option 2: LinkedIn Message to Scott Owens (CEO)

Hi Scott,

I built Golf The Bay (golfthebay.com) — a tee time aggregator for 100+ Bay Area golf courses. The name was directly inspired by your DoTheBay/DoStuff model.

The "[Verb] The Bay" format is perfect for local discovery, and I think there's natural synergy between our platforms — golf as a recreation/sports vertical for DoTheBay, cross-promotion, or content partnerships.

Would love to connect if you're open to exploring this. Either way, thanks for the naming inspiration!

[Your Name]

## Option 3: Instagram DM

**To:** https://instagram.com/dothebay

Hey! I run @golfthebay — a tee time finder for 100+ Bay Area courses. Named it as an homage to you guys. Would love to chat about a potential partnership (golf as a recreation category, cross-promo, etc). DM me or email [your email]!

## Outreach Strategy

1. **Week 1:** Send email to partnerships/advertise contact
2. **Week 1+3 days:** Send LinkedIn connection request + message to Scott Owens
3. **Week 2:** If no response, send Instagram DM as casual follow-up
4. **Week 3:** Follow up on email if no response

## Talking Points

- Golf The Bay covers 100+ public courses across SF Bay Area
- Natural brand synergy with "[Verb] The Bay" naming convention
- Overlapping demographics: active locals looking for activities
- Golf is a growing sport, especially post-2020
- Partnership benefits both: we get exposure, they get golf vertical content
